            I worked a commercial there this summer, it's a fully functional McDonald's with some additions. It has a basement below with some offices and makeup rooms. This McDonald's studio is in the city of industry in Los Angeles. Lot of fun working there, and tons of free French fries afterwards, as op said, it only gets used for commercials.Also has high studio ceilings for hanging lights and other equipment, pretty much everything from the counter to the equipment can be moved or is on wheels.
